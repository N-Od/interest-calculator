# interest-calculator
This project is a small Vue.js application that calculates simple interest

**I = P × r × t**

- **Principal** – the initial amount of money
- **Rate** – the interest rate per year (in %)
- **Time** – the number of years

The app displays both the **Interest** and the **Total Amount** (Principal + Interest).
